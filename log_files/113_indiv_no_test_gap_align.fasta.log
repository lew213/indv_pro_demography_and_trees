Host:    ip-0A66A10A (AVX512, FMA3, 15 GB RAM)
Command: /shared/home/mbxlw2/indiv_pro_iqtree/iqtree-1.6.12-Linux/bin/iqtree -s /shared/home/mbxlw2/indiv_pro_alignments/113_indiv_no_test_gap_align.fasta -m GTR+G -bb 1000
Seed:    251456 (Using SPRNG - Scalable Parallel Random Number Generator)
Time:    Thu Aug 11 11:27:34 2022
Kernel:  AVX+FMA - 1 threads (8 CPU cores detected)

HINT: Use -nt option to specify number of threads because your CPU has 8 cores!
HINT: -nt AUTO will automatically determine the best number of threads to use.
